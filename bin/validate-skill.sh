# Validate skills against the Agent Skills spec plus this repository's house rules.
#
# Spec conformance is delegated to `skills-ref`, the reference validator from
# the Agent Skills project. It parses the frontmatter with a real YAML parser
# rather than by pattern-matching lines, so it catches what a regex cannot: an
# unquoted `description:` containing a bare `: ` breaks the document, and a
# line-based check happily reports a plausible character count for frontmatter
# that no spec client can load at all.
#
# Delegated to skills-ref:
#   - the frontmatter is parseable YAML
#   - `name` present, lowercase, <= 64 chars, letters/digits/hyphens, no
#     leading, trailing, or doubled hyphen, and equal to the directory name
#   - `description` present and <= 1024 chars
#   - `compatibility` <= 500 chars
#   - no frontmatter keys outside the spec's allowed set
#
# Checked here:
#   - SKILL.md exists. Done locally so a missing file reports as itself rather
#     than as a spec violation. This is stricter than skills-ref, which also
#     accepts a lowercase `skill.md`; AGENTS.md requires `SKILL.md`.
#   - SKILL.md is under 500 lines, per AGENTS.md "Skill constraints". A skill
#     that has outgrown that is a sign it should split detail into
#     `references/` instead of loading it all up front.
#
# Registration across README.md and marketplace.json is a separate gate; see
# bin/check-skill-inventory.py.
#
# Usage: bin/validate-skill.sh [skill-directory ...]
#        With no arguments, validates every skill under skills/.
#
# Exits 0 when every target passes, 1 on any failure.
