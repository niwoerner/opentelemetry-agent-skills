# `drain`: configuration

The Drain algorithm tokenizes each log line and walks a **fixed-depth parse tree** (depth set by `tree_depth`). Lines with similar token structure land in the same **cluster**; each cluster carries a template. As more logs arrive, the template is refined — tokens that vary across a cluster's members become `<*>` wildcards while stable tokens are kept verbatim. The algorithm is deterministic: given the same configuration and a representative sample of log forms, the same token structure always yields the same template. Because of this, independent collector instances converge on identical templates once each has seen enough lines.

## Typical config

```yaml
processors:
  drain:
    template_attribute: log.record.template

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, drain]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

## Configuration reference

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|-----|------|---------|-------|
| `tree_depth` | int | `4` | Max depth of the Drain parse tree (`depth` in the paper). Higher = more specific templates. **Minimum: 3.** |
| `merge_threshold` | float | `0.4` | Minimum fraction of tokens that must match an existing cluster for a line to merge into it rather than form a new cluster (`st` in the paper). Range `[0.0, 1.0]`. |
| `max_node_children` | int | `100` | Maximum children per internal parse-tree node (`maxChild` in the paper). Bounds memory on high-cardinality token positions. |
| `max_clusters` | int | `0` | Maximum clusters tracked; when exceeded, the least-recently-used cluster is evicted. `0` = unlimited. |
| `extra_delimiters` | []string | `[]` | Additional token delimiters beyond whitespace (e.g. `[",", ":"]`). |
| `body_field` | string | `""` | If set and the body is a map, the value of this **single top-level key** is templated instead of the full body. Full OTTL paths are not supported. `""` = use the full body string. |
| `template_attribute` | string | `"log.record.template"` | Attribute key the derived template string is written to. |
| `masking_rules` | list of `{name, pattern}` | `[]` | Ordered RE2 substitutions applied before clustering. Each whole match becomes `<name>` and is emitted at `<parameter_key_prefix>.<name>`. |
| `parameter_key_prefix` | string | `"log.record.template.parameter"` | Prefix for dynamically named attributes produced by `masking_rules`. |
| `emit_wildcards` | bool | `false` | Emit body tokens occupying Drain-generated `<*>` positions as a positional string slice. |
| `wildcards_attribute` | string | `"log.record.template.wildcards"` | Attribute key for the wildcard slice. Consulted only when `emit_wildcards: true`. |
| `warmup_min_clusters` | int | `0` | Distinct clusters that must be observed before annotation starts. `0` disables warmup. |
| `storage` | component ID | `""` | ID of a storage extension used to persist the tree across restarts. `""` = disabled. |
| `save_interval` | duration | `0s` | Interval between periodic snapshot saves. `0s` = save on shutdown only. Requires `storage`. |
| `seed_templates` | []string | `[]` | Template strings pre-loaded at startup. Empty/whitespace-only entries are skipped. |
| `seed_logs` | []string | `[]` | Raw example log lines trained on at startup. Empty/whitespace-only entries are skipped. |

## Validation rules

- `tree_depth` must be `>= 3`.
- `merge_threshold` must be in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- `warmup_min_clusters` must be `>= 0`.
- `save_interval` must be `>= 0`.
- `save_interval > 0` requires `storage` to be set.
- Every masking-rule `name` must be non-empty, cannot be `*`, and cannot contain angle brackets or whitespace.
- Every masking-rule `pattern` must be a non-empty valid Go RE2 regular expression.

## Structured (map) body behavior

If the body is a map, the full serialized form is templated by default, which yields low-value templates. Set `body_field` to the **single top-level** message key (full OTTL paths like `body["event"]["message"]` are not supported), or promote that field to a plain string body upstream (e.g. a `move` operator in the filelog receiver). The full body is used unchanged if the key is absent or the body is not a map.

## Named masking and positional wildcard emission

Masking rules run in declaration order on a working copy of the body. Each whole regex match becomes a named token in the template and its original value is emitted as an attribute:

```yaml
processors:
  drain:
    masking_rules:
      - name: ip
        pattern: '\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b'
    parameter_key_prefix: log.record.template.parameter
    emit_wildcards: true
    wildcards_attribute: log.record.template.wildcards
```

For body `user alice logged in from 10.0.0.1`, masking can produce template `user <*> logged in from <ip>`, attribute `log.record.template.parameter.ip: 10.0.0.1`, and wildcard slice `["alice"]`. If a name matches multiple template positions, the first value wins and `otelcol_processor_drain_masks_duplicates` increments once per record and duplicated name. Wildcard emission uses the same tokenization as the tree and writes no slice when no `<*>` remains. During warmup suppression none of these output attributes is written.

The v0.157.0-only keys `extract_parameters` and `params_attribute` were removed in v0.158.0. Replace them with `emit_wildcards` and `wildcards_attribute`; the default output key changed from `log.record.template.params` to `log.record.template.wildcards`.
